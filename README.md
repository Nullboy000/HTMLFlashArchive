# Flash/HTML Game Archive (website)

First and foremost, all credit for the website goes to selenite-cc. Yes, I added a lot of games, but he made the style, layout, theme, and went through the insanely time consuming process of uploading all of these flash games. His original Flash Archive can be found here: https://github.com/Games-From-Flash/swf

There are 74 games on this website!!! (50 minus total games) are not flash games, and I added them. By the way, on the website, if you click the crown in the top left corner of the screen you can access my GitHub profile.
