# Flash/HTML Game Archive (website)
I don't have anything to say besides this: all credit for the website goes to selenite-cc. Yes, I added a lot of games, but he made the style, layout, theme, and went through the insanely time consuming process of uploading all of these flash games. His original Flash Archive can be found here: https://github.com/Games-From-Flash/swf
